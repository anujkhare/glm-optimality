Optimality criteria for generalized linear models

The goal of this repository is to compare the speed and accuracy of
different solvers for regularized GLMs. Type =make= on the command
line to re-do all computations.

** TODOs

- Type equations for surrogate loss functions (and constants which
  make their infimum 0), derivatives.
- What to do about numerical instability of the gaussian? Linear
  Taylor approximation of tails of the derivative?
- Figures for comparing L2 regularized models: glmnet,
  https://github.com/IshmaelBelghazi/bigoptim, MASS:lm.ridge.
- Duality gap computations for elastic net regularized interval
  regression.

[[file:figure-interval-loss-derivative.R]] computes surrogate loss and
derivative functions for interval regression using Gaussian or
Logistic likelihood.

[[file:figure-lasso-criteria.R]] computes subdifferential criteria and
duality gaps for lars, glmnet, spams solvers.
